			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my virtual humble abode!</p>
			<p>As previously stated, my name is Courtney Chu and I am a <span class="grade"><noscript></noscript></span>Computer Engineering (CPE) Major at the California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO).</p>
			<p>I grew up in a small town just north of Los Angeles called South Pasadena. It is best known for being a part of Route 66, its Fair Oaks' Pharmacy and Soda Fountain, and for originally being an ostrich farm. There was a large dispute about whether South Pasadena should be divided up so that the 710 freeway can continue unhindered. This dispute originated from the 1970's and only recently has been resolved in favor of South Pasadena.</p>
			<p>Now that your fears for my hometown have been assuaged, I can tell you a little bit about my childhood. Born in 1996, I naturally joined the following of kids who read Harry Potter. Thus, until a few years after the series ended, I devotedly read, re-read, watched, and re-watched the series from the age of six. While I didn't know every single detail of the series, if pressed, I became a veritable stream of Harry Potter knowledge. I frequently imagined myself alongside Harry Potter, Ron Weasely, and Hermione Granger as they went about their adventures and, as the years went by, grew up with them. While this fact appears to have contributed very little to my current amount of coding experience, it contributed vastly to my imagination.</p>
			<p>Note: For those curious few, I have been sorted multiple times into Slytherin, house of Severus Snape, Bellatrix Lestrange, and even Merlin.</p>
			<p>While I've always been tempted to learn Parseltongue, the language of snakes, in the real world I've tried my hand at Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, American Sign Language, Java, Python, VHDL, and Lua. The last four languages are, as I'm sure you've guessed, programming languages. My first language, Java, will always hold a special place in my heart and Python, my second language, is one that I've had the most fun with. Regrettably Python has a large amount of overhead which implies longer compilation and run times. I have since decided to find another programming language that is both lightweight and usable.</p>
			<p>While on the hunt for such a language, a friend of mine introduced me to Lua. I have not actually completed any projects in this language, but plan to use it in future games of my own design. Along this vein of thought, we come across VHDL, a language often used when programming hardware such as BASYS boards. A fellow programmer, whose site I have linked on the home page, and I were able to complete one large project and several smaller projects using VHDL. After synthesizing our code, we were able to program a BASYS 3 board and produce the expected results. As a beginning Computer Engineer, this was one of my favorite projects.</p>
			<p>My introduction to programming was an AP Computer Science class I took during my final year of high school. As beginner programmers in Java, my classmates and I were taught how to print to the console, create classes and subclasses, and eventually how to create a mini game based on GridWorld in BlueJ.</p>
