			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my virtual humble abode!</p>
			<p>My name is Courtney Chu and I am a <span class="grade"><noscript></noscript></span>Computer Engineering (CPE) Major at the California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO).</p>
			<p>I grew up in a small town just north of Los Angeles called South Pasadena. It began as an ostrich farm and is known for its Fair Oaks' Pharmacy and Soda Fountain. There was a large dispute about whether South Pasadena should be divided up so that the 710 freeway could continue unhindered. This dispute originated from the 1970's and only recently has been resolved in favor of South Pasadena.</p>
			<p>Born in 1996, I naturally joined the following of kids who read Harry Potter. Until a few years after the series ended, I devotedly read, re-read, watched, and re-watched the series from the age of six. The series contributed vastly to my thirst for knowledge and appreciation for creativity.</p>
			<p>Note: For those curious few, I have been sorted into Slytherin, house of Severus Snape, Bellatrix Lestrange, and even Merlin.</p>
			<p>I've always been tempted to learn Parseltongue, the language of snakes, but so far I've tried my hand at Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, American Sign Language, Java, Python, VHDL, C, and Lua. The last five languages are, as I'm sure you know, programming languages. Most recently, I've taken a Systems Programming class which has taught me both the language of C and a lot about pipes, forks, and even sockets.</p>
			<p>Currently, I'm interested in learning about Artificial Intellience and will hopefully be taking a course in the next year.</p>
